# NYT-API-Comment-Sentiment-Analysis

## Project Description
This is a python program that hits the NYT article search API as well as the Community API to retrieve comments from a set of articles searched from user input. S
entiment analysis is then applied to the first 25 comments, then output to a csv file.

This project was initially a final project for a class, however, I feel as though the usefulness and capabilities of the program can be expanded.

I built this program in order to find a way to gain insight into public opinion about a certain topic. The NYT comments section is a centralized place where many people discuss their opinions on a particular topic, thus making it a good platform to pull data from

## Skills Learned
This project required me to learn how to use APIs to request data from websites. Using TextBlob, also familariazed myself with sentiment analysis and natural language processing. This project was an opportunity to learn how to load data into files as well.

## Libraries used
- csv
- requests
- Textblob
