# NYT-API-Comment-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a python program that hits the NYT article search API as well as the Community API to retrieve comments from a set of articles searched from user input. S
entiment analysis is then applied to the first 25 comments, then output to a csv file.

This project was initially a final project for a class, however, I feel as though the usefulness and capabilities of the program can be expanded.
